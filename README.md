# CS50_AI
My code for CS50's Introduction to AI with Python
Please note that most of this code will not work because I have not included the data sets. The data and dependencies can be found at https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/.
In addition, not all of this code is mine. All of these projects included some pre-written code provided by the class.
